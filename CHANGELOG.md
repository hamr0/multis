## [0.13.0] - 2026-05-12

### Changed — Governance migrated to bareguard 0.4 + bare-agent 0.10

The Loop-level policy closure introduced in v0.12.0 is replaced by a real **bareguard Gate**. bareguard owns command/path allowlists, budget caps, audit JSONL, secrets redaction, and the single `humanChannel` callback for all human escalations. bareagent's `Loop` only knows about the `policy` predicate it gets from `wireGate(gate)`. multis is bareguard's first production adopter.

- **New `src/governance/gate.js`** — `createGate({config, humanPrompt, ...})` factory. Lazily `await import('bareguard')` (multis is CJS, bareguard is ESM); maps `governance.json` → `bash.allow`/`bash.denyPatterns` + `fs.readScope`/`fs.deny`; configures `secrets.envVars` + `content.askPatterns` (absorbed multis' prompt-injection patterns); routes `security.max_cost_per_run` → `budget.maxCostUsd` and `llm.max_tool_rounds` → `limits.maxTurns` (doubled — bareguard counts both LLM and tool records).
- **New `src/governance/human-channel.js`** — single `humanPrompt` closure handles both ask and halt events. Routes back to the originating chat via `event.action._ctx.{platform, chatId, senderId}` (bareguard 0.4's halt-event contract). Reuses the pending-reply Map pattern from `src/bot/checkpoint.js`.
- **Deleted `createMultisPolicy()`** from `handlers.js`. Replaced by a lazy `createGovernanceCarrier(config)` that resolves `{policy, onLlmResult, onToolResult, filterTools}` from `wireGate(gate)` on first agent loop call.
- **Action shape translation** — `translateAction()` hoists `exec → {type:'bash', cmd}`, `read_file/grep_files/find_files → {type:'read', path}` so bareguard's bash/fs primitives see the canonical fields they expect (they read `action.cmd` and `action.path` at top level, not under `args`).
- **LLM cost recording now wired** — `Loop({onLlmResult})` forwards every `provider.generate` usage to `gate.record({type:'llm'})`. Pre-BA1, `budget.maxCostUsd` only saw tool cost and was effectively a lie for token-heavy / tool-light chatbot workloads.
- **Halts no longer leak to the LLM** — bareagent throws `HaltError` from the policy on halt-severity decisions; Loop catches it and exits with `result.error = 'halt:<rule>'`. The `[HALT:]` string never reaches the model.
- **Audit split** — bareguard writes gate decisions to `~/.multis/logs/gate.jsonl` (forensic, structured by phase). multis' existing `src/governance/audit.js` keeps the 50+ app-event call sites at `~/.multis/logs/audit.log`.
- **Shared budget across chats** — every chat shares one budget cap via `~/.multis/run/budget.json` (`proper-lockfile`).
- **`Checkpoint` retained** for non-policy "always confirm" flows (e.g. `send_email`-style). Per bareagent context, Checkpoint and humanChannel coexist for distinct use cases.
- **Dropped from Loop config:** `maxCost`, `maxRounds`, `audit` (all gone in bare-agent 0.10 — moved to the Gate).
- **Tool name vocabulary preserved** — multis keeps `exec`/`read_file`/`grep_files`/`find_files` as LLM-facing names. Translation happens inside the policy shim, not at the tool definition layer.

### Dependencies

- `bare-agent` `^0.7.0` → `^0.10.1` (10.1 re-exports `HaltError` from main, adds `defaultActionTranslator`, throws on legacy `maxRounds`)
- `bareguard` `^0.4.1` added (4.1 ships the action-shape composition fix and documents the maxTurns ratio)

### Tests

- 403/403 passing. `test/governance.test.js` fully rewritten against the new shape: governance.json → Gate config mapping, action translation, owner gate, end-to-end with fileless audit (`audit.path: null` from bareguard 0.4), halt routing via `event.action._ctx`.

### Adopter feedback round-trip

Three of the four items I filed during the v0.13.0 integration shipped in patch releases by the time the docs landed:

- ✅ **`HaltError` now in `require('bare-agent')`** (bareagent 0.10.1). Dropped the `require.resolve('bare-agent')` + walk-to-`src/errors.js` workaround — back to a clean `const { HaltError } = require('bare-agent')`.
- ✅ **`wireGate(gate, { actionTranslator })`** + exported `defaultActionTranslator` (bareagent 0.10.1). Replaces multis' custom policy shim. The translator hoists `exec → bash.cmd` and `read_file → fs.path` at the seam instead of bypassing wireGate. multis still keeps owner-bypass + symlink resolution on its side (multis-specific behavior, not adapter concerns).
- ✅ **`Loop({ maxRounds })` now throws** with a migration pointer to `limits.maxTurns` (bareagent 0.10.1). Catches anyone migrating from 0.9.
- ✅ **maxTurns semantics documented** in bareguard 0.4.1 README. `maxTurns: rounds * 2` is the recommended pattern.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-04-16

### Changed — Governance consolidation (bare-agent v0.7.0)

Multis had two parallel governance systems (command/path allowlist in `validate.js` called from `executor.js`, plus a separate checkpoint tool list). Both are now replaced by **one policy closure** wired into bareagent's Loop at construction time — one hook gates every tool call with per-caller `ctx` routing.

- **Deleted** `src/governance/validate.js` — replaced by `bare-agent/policy` helpers (`pathAllowlist`, `commandAllowlist`, `combinePolicies`). Same `governance.json` config file, same rules, zero duplication.
- **Stripped governance from `executor.js`** — `isCommandAllowed` / `isPathAllowed` / `requireConfirmation` removed. Shell-out logic stays (25+ tools still call `execCommand`). Governance is Loop-level now.
- **New `createMultisPolicy()`** in `handlers.js` — reads `governance.json`, builds a combined policy closure, wired into `Loop({ policy })` with `ctx: { senderId, chatId, isOwner }` forwarded per-run.
- **Dropped dead code:** `requireConfirmation` (printed a message but had no path to confirm), `governance.enabled` flag (always-on, never gated), unused config fields (`rateLimits`, `business.allowed_urls/topics/rules`, `documents.maxSize/allowedTypes`, `governance.auditLog`).
- **Symlink traversal fix** — policy closure resolves `realpathSync` before path allowlist check.
- **`maxCost`** wired from `config.security.max_cost_per_run` (optional runaway cap).
- **`onError`** callback writes Loop errors to audit log with chatId context.

### Changed — Checkpoint simplification

- Removed custom timeout timer from `checkpoint.js`. Uses bareagent's built-in `Checkpoint({ timeout })` — on expiry, auto-denies and routes through `loop:error` + `onError`. No silent hangs.

### Security

- **PIN:** `verifyPin` now uses `crypto.timingSafeEqual` (constant-time comparison).
- **PIN:** Session file mode `0o600`, directory mode `0o700` (owner-only).

### Dependencies

- `bare-agent` `^0.3.0` → `^0.7.0`

### Tests

- 395/395 passing (zero regressions). Governance tests rewritten to use `bare-agent/policy` helpers.

## [0.11.2] - 2026-02-28

### Added
- `/mode business` unified menu — replaces `/business` command with 5-option menu (setup, show, clear, global default, assign chats)
- Wizard skip/clear support — re-running wizard shows current values, "skip" preserves them, "clear" resets topics/rules
- Single-line topic format — "Topic: Description" instead of 2-message flow
- Step headers in wizard (Step 1/5 — Name, etc.)
- Emoji/short message guard — emoji-only messages in business chats are silently ignored (no "Usage: /ask" leak)

### Removed
- `/business` command — all functionality moved to `/mode business` menu

### Changed
- Wizard pre-populates from existing `config.business` values
- "Topic: Description" single-line format replaces the 2-step name+description flow

## [0.11.1] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed
- `/mode` picker replies silently dropped — personal/Note-to-self chat defaulted to `off` mode, which allowed `/commands` but blocked non-command replies like picker selections
- `_pendingMode` keyed by `chatId` instead of `senderId` — Beeper senderId can vary across messages from the same user
- `/mode` picker now loops properly: digits select, `/commands` cancel, other text prompts user to pick a number

### Changed
- Personal/Note-to-self chats default to `personal` mode (never restricted) — they are admin command channels
- `/mode` read-only listing now shows numbered entries on both Telegram and Beeper

## [0.11.0] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- `config.chats` as single source of truth for chat metadata (name, network, platform, mode, lastActive)
- `escalate` tool: LLM-driven escalation — sends notifications to ALL admin channels (Telegram + Beeper Note-to-self) automatically, no config needed
- `getAdminChatIds()` on BeeperPlatform — exposes self/note-to-self chats for admin notifications
- Admin presence pause: owner typing in business chat pauses bot for configurable duration (default 30min)
- `/business setup` wizard: input validation (name 2-100 chars, greeting max 500, topics/rules max 200)
- Config backup: `config.json.bak` created before Beeper API discovery writes
- `updateChatMeta()` for upserting chat entries into config.chats
- `platformRegistry` passed to all tool ctx objects (routeAsk, scheduler tick, plan steps)

### Changed
- Business escalation: replaced keyword short-circuit with LLM-driven escalation via `escalate` tool — all business messages now flow through LLM
- Escalation notifications auto-resolve admin channels from platform registry (Telegram owner_id + Beeper self-chats) — `admin_chat` config is optional override only
- `/business setup` wizard: `/commands` typed during wizard now cancel and re-route (no longer swallowed as input)
- `setChatMode()` / `getChatMode()` read/write from `config.chats[chatId].mode` instead of `config.platforms.beeper.chat_modes`
- `listBeeperChats()` reads from `config.chats` (no Beeper API call needed)
- `findBeeperChat()` searches `config.chats` first, falls back to Beeper API for unknown chats
- `buildBusinessPrompt()` escalation guidance rewritten: LLM uses escalate tool, responds naturally and empathetically

### Removed
- `profile.json` per-chat files: `loadProfile()`, `saveProfile()`, `updateProfile()`, `profilePath` removed from ChatMemoryManager
- Keyword short-circuit block in business routing (replaced by LLM + escalate tool)
- `admin_chat` wizard step (auto-resolved from platform registry instead)

### Fixed
- Admin pause: nullish coalescing (`??`) instead of OR (`||`) for `admin_pause_minutes` — 0 is now valid
- Business routing missing `platformRegistry` in toolDeps — escalate tool silently failed to send notifications

## [0.10.0] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- Two-stage memory pipeline: recent → memory.md (stage 1) → DB condensation (stage 2)
- Silent mode capture: silent chats now trigger memory summarization pipeline
- Chat metadata persistence: displayName, network saved to profile.json
- `runCondenseMemory()` for stage 2 memory condensation
- `countMemorySections()` and `updateProfile()` on ChatMemoryManager
- `network` field on normalized Message class

### Changed
- Capture threshold from 20 → 10 messages (was already default, now explicit)
- Off mode is strict zero-I/O: no logs, no recent, no memory
- Personal/note-to-self chats can no longer be set to silent or off
- Off-mode self messages that aren't commands are now skipped in Beeper

### Fixed
- Silent mode chats never triggered capture despite accumulating messages

## [0.9.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- Beeper file indexing: send PDF/DOCX/MD/TXT via Note-to-self with `/index <scope>` to download and index
- Interactive scope prompt when no scope specified (reply 1 for public, 2 for admin)
- `BeeperPlatform.downloadAsset()` for Beeper Desktop API file downloads
- `/business setup|show|clear` command with conversational wizard for configuring business persona
- `buildBusinessPrompt()` compiles structured config (name, greeting, topics, rules, allowed_urls) into system prompt
- Business mode LLM always responds — no more canned "rephrase" messages on 0 KB matches
- `allowed_urls` field in business config for reference links in customer responses

### Changed
- Removed retry-based escalation (`max_retries_before_escalate`, `escalationRetries` Map)
- Keyword escalation still works — "refund", "complaint" etc. fast-track to admin
- `admin_chat` moved into `escalation` sub-object (legacy location still migrated)

### Fixed
- Removed stale DEBUG log from Beeper adapter

## [0.8.0] - 2026-02-20

### Fixed
- Beeper hibernate/sleep detection: re-seed seen messages after >30s poll gap

### Added
- Multi-agent personas: `config.agents` with per-agent persona and model

### Fixed
- Beeper triple-response: `Number()` on non-numeric IDs = NaN broke dedup → string Set
- `isOwner` broken for Beeper (Telegram ID vs Beeper senderId) → `msg.isSelf`
- Schema migration crash: CREATE INDEX before migration → reordered
- Double-stringified JSON in capture
- Removed `isSelf` PIN bypass

### Changed
- Beeper commands restricted to personal chats only
- Mode semantics clarified: off = ignore, silent = archive only, business = auto-respond
