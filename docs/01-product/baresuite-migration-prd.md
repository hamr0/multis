# PRD — multis → baresuite migration

**This is the sole guiding document for the migration.** Every POC, lib-feedback round, and module ships against this doc. It supersedes `docs/04-process/baresuite-migration.md` (removed).

**Status:** Active · **Owner:** hamr0 · **Created:** 2026-06-15
**Baseline:** multis v0.14.0 — `bare-agent ^0.10.2`, `bareguard ^0.4.2`, no litectx, homegrown memory + indexer.
**Target:** multis as the **first real customer of the full baresuite** — `bare-agent 0.16`, `bareguard 0.7`, `litectx 0.16` (memory **and** context-engineering), beeperbox-swappable Beeper. Every homegrown agent primitive retired.

---

## 1. Goal

Two goals, equal weight:
1. **Finish multis** as a real product (local-first chatbot/assistant for personal + small-business use, Telegram + Beeper).
2. **Validate the baresuite by consuming it for real.** multis is the dogfood that proves — and grows — bareagent, bareguard, litectx, beeperbox.

---

## 2. Principles (govern every module)

1. **No papering over.** If a job belongs to a lib and the lib can't do it yet, **push the lib to grow/change** — never shim, wrap, or re-implement inside multis. A discovered gap is a *stop-and-file* event, logged in §7.
2. **multis changes only for multis's job** — domain mapping, policy, platform glue, UX.
3. **Rebuild, don't refit.** Homegrown code a lib now owns is **deleted and rebuilt bottom-up on the lib**, not adapted behind an interface. Setup/config/CLI/tools/platform adapters stay.
4. **POC by POC, always waiting for the lib.** Each module is a POC aimed at its *riskiest assumption* (per `AGENT_RULES.md`). If the POC exposes a lib gap → file it → **wait for the lib to adjust** → resume. No leaping ahead.
5. **Sequential, logical building blocks.** Foundation libs current before building on them; substrate (index) before memory; memory before context-engineering. Never start a block whose dependency isn't green.
6. **Simplify as we go.** Pre-existing multis design is not sacred. Any module may propose dropping bloat toward simpler/no-bloat — questioning the design is encouraged, on both sides. Recorded in §6.
7. **Prove, don't assert.** A module is "done" only with a passing validation gate (§ per-module). Measure anything called cheap/fast.
8. **Stay in multis's lane.** This work touches **multis only**. When a finding belongs to a lib, the deliverable from here is a **clear, written ask** in §7 — exactly what that lib must change and why — not a fix authored from multis. Each repo carries its own work; I do not edit lib source, file issues in lib repos, or design a lib's internal solution. Consumer-level integration against a lib's **public API** (wiring + a POC to see if the surface already suffices) is in-lane; reading lib internals to author their fix is not. If multis's part is blocked on a lib ask, multis **waits** (Principle 4).

---

## 3. The working loop (per module)

```
pick next module (deps green)
  → POC the riskiest assumption against the real lib
      → lib does the job?  ── yes ─→ build clean (delete homegrown, rebuild lib-native)
      │                     ── no  ─→ file upstream ask (§7) ─→ WAIT for lib release ─→ re-POC
      → validation gate green (suite + smoke→CI + any manual round-trip)
      → ship module ─→ next
```

We do not batch modules. One block at a time, each green on its own before the next.

---

## 4. Decisions

### Locked
- **§A Per-chat isolation — shared litectx DB + `owner`/`session` scopes.** One DB; `kb → global` (owner NULL), `user:<chatId> → owner=<chatId>`, `admin → owner='admin'`. (Enables cross-chat admin/kb; it's what scopes are for.)
- **§B Capture — B2 (pure promotion ladder) + explicit `/remember` direct fact-write.** Passive usefulness-weighted memory via litectx's ladder; active instant memory on command. Retires the homegrown LLM summarize/condense pipeline entirely. *Expected: leans on litectx ladder (slice 5b); M4 may block on a litectx release — that wait is the validation, not a problem (Principle 4).*
- **§C Recall — C1 (host-side injection) now, C2 (recall/impact as LLM tools via MCP) opt-in later.** Cheap, predictable, one round per turn; agentic recall added additively once the substrate is stable.
- **§D PDF/DOCX — litectx ingests + chunks.** If a format/chunking falls short, **litectx changes** (Principle 1); only if we decide the format isn't worth litectx owning do we reconsider. multis does **not** keep a parallel parser path as a workaround.
- **§E beeperbox boundary — verbs in beeperbox, policy in the integrator.** multis and beeperbox serve the *same job* — an assistant that watches chats and selectively interacts — at different layers. **beeperbox owns transport + normalization + composable capability primitives** — the *verbs*: watch passively (observe with no side-effects / no auto-read), select/address a specific chat, send to a chat, identify self/own-messages, new-messages-since-cursor. **multis (the integrator) owns policy** — the *decision*: which chats to watch, whether/when to respond (`off`/`silent`/`business` modes), owner, persona, escalation. **Rule: mechanism in beeperbox, policy in the integrator** — beeperbox never bakes in "respond to chat X," only the *ability* to compose it (respond to all / some / none is the integrator's call). **Parity** = the same heuristics/shapes at the boundary; multis stops hand-rolling what beeperbox can expose as a verb. **Bidirectional refit:** multis adopts beeperbox's normalization (note-to-self = `participants.total===1 && items[0].isSelf`, client-side limit slicing); beeperbox adopts multis's hard-won watch lessons (a robust new-messages-since primitive + unambiguous self-message flags — drafted as asks in §7, not authored from multis). beeperbox is the documented **self-host-on-VPS** deploy path for multis. *The mode/response policy itself predates POC-first (4.5 era) — the refit re-validates it with a POC, not just ports it.*

> Five locked. A module blocking on a lib release is an expected, accepted outcome — it is the lib-validation working as intended (Principle 4), not a schedule risk to engineer around.

## 5. Ownership map (post-migration end state)

| Code today | Job | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `src/memory/*` (recent.json → memory.md → FTS5 → ACT-R) | **litectx** | rip out, rebuild |
| `src/indexer/*` (FTS5 store, chunking) | **litectx** | rip out, rebuild |
| prompt/context assembly (`prompts.js`, no budget-fit) | **litectx CE** | build fresh |
| `runAgentLoop` wrapper | **bare-agent Loop** | thin toward zero |
| `provider-adapter.js`, `scheduler.js`, retry/CB | **bare-agent** | keep thin, restate on current API |
| ~~`checkpoint.js`~~ | **bareguard** (`flags`) | ✅ deleted — confirm-before-exec via `flags` + single humanChannel (F2 cutover) |
| `buildGateConfig`, action translator, owner model | **multis** (domain→gate) | keep, clean only |
| `governance/audit.js` (app events) | **multis** | keep |
| `tools/definitions.js` | **multis** | keep |
| `platforms/*` | **multis** | keep; beeper endpoint configurable |
| PIN/security, escalation, modes, business persona | **multis** | keep |

## 6. Module breakdown

Each module: **Goal · Riskiest assumption (POC) · Remove · Build clean · Ownership · Upstream watch · Validation gate · Exit.**

### M0 — Validation net *(build first; no lib dep)* ✅ DONE (2026-06-15)
- **Goal:** regression gate so "done" is evidence, not assertion.
- **POC:** can a mock LLM + real `fileless` Gate drive the real router end-to-end?
- **Remove:** nothing. **Build:** `test/e2e/router.test.js`; lift `mockToolProvider` into `test/helpers/setup.js`.
- **Ownership:** multis. **Upstream watch:** —
- **Gate / Exit:** ✅ suite green + e2e cases for smoke steps 5,6,7,8,9,10,11. Net earned its keep immediately — surfaced F1 (slash gate bypass, fixed in-lane), F2, F3.

### M1 — bareguard 0.4.2 → 0.7.0 *(dep: M0)* ✅ DONE (2026-06-15)
- **Goal:** foundation gate current. Assessed additive.
- **POC:** does the existing `buildGateConfig` + governance.test.js pass unchanged on 0.7?
- **Remove:** nothing. **Build:** bump + reinstall.
- **Ownership:** lib. **Upstream watch:** any 0.4-era config silently no-ops → file.
- **Gate / Exit:** ✅ full suite green on the bump. Bonus: F2 (§7) is answered by 0.7.0's `flags` primitive — consumed in the F2 cutover (§8).

### M2 — bare-agent 0.10.2 → 0.16.1 *(dep: M1)* ✅ DONE (2026-06-15)
- **Goal:** foundation loop current; unlock `assemble`/`trim` hooks for M5.
- **POC:** spot-check 3 non-additive items — checkpoint fail-closed (`yes/y/approve` only), `err.body` omitted by default, CLI config requires `gate`.
- **Remove:** dead `maxRounds`-era paths surfaced by the bump. **Build:** bump + reinstall.
- **Ownership:** lib. **Upstream watch:** missing model in loop cost table → file (don't hardcode).
- **Gate / Exit:** ✅ full suite green. Pinned **0.16.1** (the F3 fix release, not 0.16.0). F3 (§7) resolved → real cost-accrual budget-halt e2e replaces the M0 direct-injection scaffold, failability-proven.

### M-B — Beeper endpoint configurable + beeperbox swap *(dep: M0; parallel to M1/M2)* — governed by §E
- **Goal:** decouple Beeper client from local Desktop; validate the **beeperbox** container swap (cheapest full baresuite-customer test). Bidirectional refit per §E.
- **POC:** ✅ **VALIDATED (2026-06-15)** — multis's *real* `BeeperPlatform` client, pointed at a beeperbox container by config alone (`beeper.url`), completed a full send→read-back round-trip via the "Note to self" chat. `/v1/accounts` + `/v1/chats` shapes match multis's reader unchanged. Spike threw away after.
- **Spike findings:** (1) `beeper.url` is *already* configurable — the work is token-source + parity, not just URL; (2) `/v1/chats` is hard-capped at 25 (recency-ordered) → multis's poller can't see older chats (latent bound, document or use `/v1/messages/search`); (3) multis's note-to-self rule (`every(isSelf)`) is looser than beeperbox's canonical `total===1 && isSelf`; (4) `?limit` is ignored (loose) → slice client-side; (5) `_loadToken` reads multis's own path, not the deploy's token source.
- **Remove:** hard-coded token path; looser hand-rolled heuristics. **Build (multis ← beeperbox parity):** token from config/secret store; adopt canonical note-to-self rule + client-side limit slicing; document the recent-25 polling bound. No new dependency.
- **Asks (beeperbox ← multis, §7, §E):** robust new-messages-since-cursor *passive watch* primitive + unambiguous self-message flags (multis's seed/poll/dedup bug-class belongs in transport). — **DELIVERED + VERIFIED (2026-06-15):** `poll_messages` + exact-id `source:"api"` echo-guard (beeperbox PR #11/#13) and container stability (PR #12/#13), all verified live against the rebuilt container (§7). **Step-3 consumption** — rewire `beeper.js` onto `poll_messages`, drop the `[multis]` prefix + `_isLooping` + hand-rolled seed/dedup/wake-reseed — is now **unblocked**. **Phase 1 DONE (2026-06-16):** vanilla MCP client `src/platforms/beeperbox-mcp.js` (no new dep; 17 tests, abort + `isError` mechanisms mutation-proven; live-smoked against the container). **Phase 2 DONE (2026-06-16):** `beeper.js` rewired onto the client — `poll_messages` cursor (persisted to `~/.multis/run/beeper-cursor.json`, restart-resumable, drains `has_more`), `source:"api"` echo-guard, `client_tag` sends, `get_chat`-cached chat metadata; dropped `[multis]` prefix, `_isLooping`, `selfIds`/`_isSelf`, `_seen`/`_processing`, `_seedLastSeen`, the 30s-gap re-seed. Policy unchanged. 434/434 green; echo-guard + drain-cap tests mutation-proven; live-smoked against the running container (send→poll→echo-guard skip→get_chat note-to-self, all PASS). **multis is now a pure MCP client for watch/send — it no longer speaks raw `/v1/` for Beeper** (only `downloadAsset` still does, pending the attachments verb). **Bare Beeper Desktop is NOT dropped** — it's served by beeperbox's standalone *lite mode*: `mcp/server.js` is zero-dep vanilla Node and takes `BEEPER_API`, so a user runs `BEEPER_API=http://localhost:23373 node mcp/server.js` against their existing local Desktop and multis talks MCP to it. Same beeperbox verb surface across all three deploys (container / local-lite / remote) → one multis client. **Dual-transport-in-multis was considered and rejected (§8).** **Attachments deferred to a beeperbox verb (§7, 2026-06-16)** — paused in multis, no shim. **Phase 3 (reframed):** 3a backend validation + startup logging; 3b `findBeeperChat`/`downloadAsset` → MCP verbs (so remote `:23375`-only works); 3c tests; 3d beeperbox asks (attachments + package lite mode, §7); 3e doc + wizard reframe to the three deploy shapes + limitations matrix.
- **Ownership:** multis owns policy; beeperbox owns transport/normalization/verbs (§E). **Upstream watch:** any verb multis still hand-rolls → candidate beeperbox primitive.
- **Gate / Exit:** `beeper.test.js` parametrized on base URL; default behavior preserved; round-trip recorded (done); README documents beeperbox as the self-host-on-VPS deploy path.

### M3 — litectx doc index *(dep: M1, M2)* — replaces `src/indexer/*`
- **Goal:** retire homegrown FTS5 + chunking; rebuild `/index` `/search` `/docs` on `LiteCtx`.
- **POC (riskiest):** does litectx ingest + chunk multis's real PDF/DOCX corpus and return usable recall under the §A scope model? (per §D, if not → push litectx, wait.)
- **Remove:** `src/indexer/store.js`, homegrown chunker (and `parsers/` iff litectx ingests the format).
- **Build:** thin `src/index/*` over `new LiteCtx({ root, include, owner, session })`; routes call `index()`/`recall({kind})`/`get()`. Scope mapping per §A.
- **Ownership:** litectx (ranking/chunking/storage). **Upstream watch:** PDF/DOCX ingest, scope semantics, BM25 quality.
- **Gate / Exit:** indexer/parsers tests rebuilt on recall; smoke step 4 green via e2e.

### M4 — litectx memory *(dep: M3)* — replaces `src/memory/*`
- **Goal:** retire recent.json window, memory.md, two-stage condense, ACT-R; rebuild on litectx kinds.
- **POC (riskiest):** does the **promotion ladder** (§B B2) produce the right durable facts from real episode traffic, with §A per-chat scope isolation holding? (co-dev with litectx likely.)
- **Remove:** `memory/manager.js`, `memory/capture.js`.
- **Build:** window → `episode`; durable → `fact`; condense → `promotionCandidates()`; `/memory` `/remember` `/forget` → recall/remember/forget (explicit `/remember` = direct fact-write).
- **Ownership:** litectx (store/ranking/decay/promotion). **Upstream watch:** scope filter, promotion thresholds, recall grouping.
- **Gate / Exit:** memory/recall tests rebuilt; smoke step 12 → e2e where possible.

### M5 — litectx context-engineering *(dep: M4)* — new
- **Goal:** budget-fitting multis never had; close "litectx = memory + CE".
- **POC (riskiest):** does `Loop({assemble,trim})` ↔ litectx `unitAssembler`/`unitTrimmer` keep recency + atomic tool bundles within a token budget on a long chat?
- **Remove:** ad-hoc prompt stuffing in `prompts.js`.
- **Build:** wire hooks via bare-agent `toUnits`/`fromUnits`/`harvestKey`; optional `summaryWindow` for long chats.
- **Ownership:** litectx (budget-fit/compress/harvest). **Upstream watch:** pinning/atomic invariants multis needs.
- **Gate / Exit:** e2e budget-bound + recency cases; ask flow unregressed.

### M6 — thin the loop *(dep: M2, M5)*
- **Goal:** remove multis wrapping bare-agent 0.16 now covers; `runAgentLoop` → near-direct `Loop.run`.
- **Ownership:** bare-agent. **Gate / Exit:** agent-loop integration tests green.

### M7 — writeGate + impact *(optional; dep: M4)*
- **Goal:** cross-lib seams — litectx `writeGate` ↔ the same bareguard Gate; `impact()` before destructive owner actions.
- **Ownership:** lib seam. **Gate / Exit:** e2e deny-on-bad-write case.

## 7. Lib feedback log *(append as we go — every upstream ask)*

| Date | Module | Lib | Ask | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-06-15 | M0 / F3 | bare-agent | `CircuitBreaker.wrapProvider` returns only `{generate}`, dropping `.model`. `Loop` reads `this.provider.model` (loop.js:181) for `estimateCost`, which returns null on a null model → `budget.maxCostUsd` accrues **no** LLM token cost whenever a wrapped provider is used. Two bare-agent primitives compose to silently disable the cost cap. Fix: `wrapProvider` should preserve `model`, or `Loop` should fall back to `result.model`. | **RESOLVED (2026-06-15)** — shipped in **bare-agent 0.16.1**: `wrapProvider` preserves passthrough props, `Loop` falls back to `result.model`, providers emit `model`. multis pins `^0.16.1`; real cost-accrual budget-halt e2e (M2) proves the cap halts, failability-confirmed. |
| 2026-06-15 | F2 | bareguard | **Need a per-tool / per-action-type "always ask" primitive.** multis must route blanket per-tool confirmation (e.g. confirm before **every** `exec`/`bash`) through bareguard's single humanChannel — governance = bareguard, no local drift. **Requirements:** (1) fires on **every** action of the configured type/tool, **not** preempted by an allow decision or silenced by `tools.allowlist`/`bash.allow`; (2) routes through the existing humanChannel as `kind:"ask"` with `event.action` + `event.action._ctx` intact (host routes the prompt back to the originating chat, applies allow/deny/terminate); (3) config-driven, composable with existing deny/ask patterns. **Proposed shape (bareguard's call):** `confirm:{ types:['bash'] }` or `bash:{ ask:true }` / `fs:{ ask:true }`, **or** confirm `flags`-ask is the intended mechanism and document correct usage. **Consumer repro (didn't fire):** minimal gate `flags:{ confirm:{ yes:'ask' } }` + action `{ type:'bash', args:{command:'ls'}, confirm:'yes' }` → `check` returned `allow`, humanChannel never called. (Stated as observation; bareguard to confirm usage or provide the primitive.) **Acceptance:** a configured always-ask type invokes humanChannel (kind `ask`) for every such action; `_ctx` preserved; deny blocks, allow proceeds. | **RESOLVED (2026-06-15)** — no new primitive: the existing `flags` primitive (bareguard ≥0.6.0, present in 0.7.0) is the mechanism. `flags:{type:{bash:'ask'}}` fires at step 4b before the allowlist; the repro failed only on 0.4.2 (pre-`flags`). All acceptance criteria proven against the published `Gate` (with negative controls). Consumed in the F2 cutover (§8). |
| 2026-06-15 | M-B / §E | beeperbox | **Expose the assistant-watch *verbs* natively (ability, not policy).** A passive-watch integrator (multis-class) currently hand-rolls seed→poll→dedup on raw `/v1/chats` and bleeds a known bug-class (NaN dedup → triple responses, wake-flood, reprocessing-after-restart). That loop is *transport*, not policy. **Resolved shape (forks signed off 2026-06-15):** (1) **`poll_messages`** — honest name; it's a cursor-advancing poll, not a stream (PRD §3 non-streaming). (2) **Global feed + optional `chat_id`** — one call returns all new messages across recent chats since the cursor (kills the whole inbox-wide loop, not just per-chat); bounded by Beeper's ~20-chat live-sync (document). (3) **No implicit mark-read** (passive); restart-resumable via an opaque cursor (`{ts,ids}`, strict-after comparator — kills same-ms dedup/miss). (4) **Self-flag, SHARPENED:** `is_self` alone is **not** an echo-guard — on one account the human's own typed messages AND the bot's API replies are *both* `is_self`, and multis *must* receive the human's (Note-to-self commands). So include self by default; the real need is a marker on messages **sent through beeperbox's own send API** (echoed `client_tag`/idempotency key, or `source:"api"`), *distinct from `is_self`* — "did **I** send this," not "is this from my account." Retires multis's `[multis]`-text-prefix hack. **Boundary (§E):** ability to watch/address/send; never bakes in "respond to chat X." **Acceptance:** incremental watch, no missed/dup across restart; a bot skips its own API sends while still seeing the human's own messages. | **RESOLVED (2026-06-15)** — shipped in **beeperbox PR #11**: `poll_messages` (cursor-advancing global feed, optional `chat_id`, no implicit mark-read, opaque restart-resumable cursor) + `source:"api"`/`client_tag` echo-guard with a sent-ledger persisted to the config volume. multis ran a Phase-0 spike against the live container: seed→poll, **exactly-once within a single cursor chain** (4 sequential sends, 0 dup / 0 loss), and `source:"api"`+`client_tag` round-trip confirmed. **Follow-up (new ask below):** the echo-guard currently degrades to text/content matching because the Beeper message id swaps on bridge-ack — see "reliable echo via id resolution." |
| 2026-06-15 | M-B | beeperbox | **Make the raw-`/v1/` consumption contract explicit.** `/v1/chats?limit=N` silently caps at 25, recency-ordered (verified: `limit=25/100/300` → 25) with no signal; a poller silently misses older chats. The MCP layer already encodes the canonical heuristics (note-to-self `total===1 && isSelf`, `is_group`, client-side limit slicing) but raw consumers can't see them and hand-roll divergent versions. **Want:** (1) document the `/v1/chats` cap + a cursor enumeration path (search returns `oldest/newestCursor`); (2) publish the canonical heuristics as the raw-consumer contract. **Acceptance:** a `/v1/`-only app can enumerate beyond recent-25 and match MCP-layer classification without reverse-engineering it. | **RESOLVED (2026-06-15)** — beeperbox PR #11 documented the raw-`/v1/` contract (the 25-cap, client-side cursor enumeration, canonical heuristics) in `beeperbox.context.md` + `docs/GUIDE.md`. |
| 2026-06-15 | M-B step 3 | beeperbox | **Make the `source:"api"` echo-guard exact-id reliable — stop degrading to text matching.** beeperbox's sent-ledger records the **`pendingMessageID`** the send returns, then matches read-backs by exact `id`. That match **always misses**: Beeper swaps the id on bridge-ack. Verified on the live container — send → `pendingMessageID: ~beeper-mautrix-go_<txn>`; the same message on read-back has a **final numeric `id`** (e.g. `908`) and the read-back object carries **no** `pendingMessageID`/txn/event field linking back (full key dump: `id,chatID,accountID,senderID,senderName,timestamp,sortKey,type,text,isSender,isDeleted,mentions,seen`). So every echo match falls through to the 15-min **content/text-hash** fallback — fragile by exactly the failure modes multis is trying to retire (a human re-typing identical text in-window, or a repeated bot ack, defeats it). **The Beeper API already documents the reliable path** (`GET /v1/spec`): *"Sends return a `pendingMessageID`; resolve it with `GET /v1/chats/{chatID}/messages/{messageID}` or wait for `message.upserted` over the WebSocket"*, and that GET *"Retrieve a message by final message ID, **pendingMessageID**, or Matrix event ID."* **Proven (live container):** `GET .../messages/{pendingMessageID}` returns the settled message with its **final `id`** on the first attempt (`~..._10` → `908`). **Ask:** on send, resolve `pendingMessageID` → final `id` (eagerly via that GET, or by subscribing the `message.upserted` WebSocket which carries the pending→final transition) and store the **final id** in the ledger; then tag `source:"api"` by **exact final-id** match, with text/content as last-ditch fallback only. **Boundary (§E):** reliable own-send identification is a transport verb — belongs in beeperbox, not re-hacked in multis. **Acceptance:** a `send_message`/`note_to_self` message is tagged `source:"api"` on read-back via **exact id** (no text dependence); two distinct sends with identical text in one chat are both tagged; a human typing the same text is **not** mis-tagged. Lets multis drop its `_isLooping` text backstop entirely. | **RESOLVED (2026-06-15)** — shipped in **beeperbox PR #13** (master `1ad498d`, `:edge` image built): `send_message`/`note_to_self` resolve `pendingMessageID` → bridge id and tag `source:"api"` by **exact id**, text fallback only when unresolved; bounded resolve latency (`beeperFetch` timeout + `RESOLVE_TIMEOUT_MS`), shutdown-race guard. The live pending→final resolution is CI-unverifiable (no Beeper account in CI) — **multis is the verifier**; re-validate exact-id echo against the live `:edge` container before dropping `_isLooping`. **multis VERIFIED (2026-06-15):** exact-id discriminator passed on the rebuilt `#13` container — two identical-text `note_to_self` sends each came back `source:"api"` tagged with its OWN `client_tag` (`909→valA`, `910→valB`, no crossing — text-only matching cannot do this); the send response now returns the resolved final `message_id` + `resolved:true`. Echo-guard is exact-id reliable → multis may drop `_isLooping`. |
| 2026-06-16 | M-B step 3 | beeperbox | **Package/document "lite mode" — the MCP server run standalone against an existing local Beeper Desktop.** `mcp/server.js` is already zero-dep vanilla Node and honors `BEEPER_API` (`server.js:12`), so `BEEPER_API=http://localhost:23373 BEEPER_TOKEN=… node mcp/server.js` fronts a user's local Desktop with no container/Electron. This is what lets multis (and any MCP client) stay single-transport while still supporting bare Desktop — the capability **exists** but isn't surfaced as a supported path. **Ask:** a first-class entry point + docs — e.g. an `npx beeperbox-mcp` / `beeperbox-mcp --beeper-api …` bin and a README "front your existing Beeper Desktop" section (vs. the full headless container). Clarify token sourcing (the user's Desktop dev token) and the loopback/`MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` posture for local use. **Acceptance:** documented one-command way to run the MCP verb server against a local Desktop; multis's GUIDE can point bare-Desktop users at it. | **FILED (2026-06-16)** — capability present (`BEEPER_API`); awaiting a packaged entry point + docs. |
| 2026-06-16 | M-B step 3 | beeperbox | **Surface message attachments through the watch/read verbs — they're dropped today.** `normalizeMessage` (`mcp/server.js:234`) maps id/sender/text/type/timestamp/reply but **omits the raw `attachments` array** Beeper provides on `/v1/chats/{id}/messages`. So a media message arrives over `poll_messages`/`read_chat` as `type:"MEDIA"`, `text:"[MEDIA]"`, with **no handle to the file** — breaking the integrator's "owner sends a PDF → index it into the KB" flow and any customer-attachment capture. Verbs own transport+normalization (§E); attachment exposure is a transport verb, not policy → belongs in beeperbox. **Two parts:** **(1) REQUIRED, low effort — add `attachments[]` to the normalized message.** Pure passthrough of data already on the raw object; per entry the integrator needs `file_name`, `mime_type`, `src_url` (the `mxc://…`) and/or `id` (download ref), optionally `type`/`size`. This alone unblocks the **local** deploy because the integrator can still resolve the file via the raw `/v1/assets/download` on `:23373` (which the container already exposes). **(2) REQUIRED for MCP-only / remote — add a `download_asset` verb.** Today asset retrieval reaches around the MCP boundary to the raw `:23373` API; that breaks the MCP-only contract and any remote beeperbox where only `:23375` is published. A verb takes the attachment ref (`src_url` or `message_id`+index) and returns the bytes. **Bytes-transport is beeperbox's design call:** base64 in the tool result (simplest, remote-safe, cap the size — recommended) / a short-lived stream URL on `:23375` / (NOT a container-local path — integrator doesn't share the FS). **Boundary (§E):** mechanism in beeperbox. **Acceptance:** a polled media message carries `attachments[]` with a resolvable ref; an integrator with **only** `:23375` reachable can fetch the bytes and index the file. **multis status:** Phase-2 rewire shipped without attachment passthrough (no shim, per Principle 1); the `downloadAsset`/raw-`:23373` seam is retained so #1 lights it up immediately. Beeper attachment indexing is **paused in multis until #1 ships**. | **FILED (2026-06-16)** — awaiting beeperbox. #1 unblocks local; #2 unblocks MCP-only/remote. |
| 2026-06-15 | M-B step 3 / ops | beeperbox | **Container lifecycle robustness — 2 fixes (observed this session).** **(1) `docker restart` reliably SIGSEGVs `beepertexts`.** A stale Xvfb lock (`/tmp/.X99-lock`, `/tmp/.X11-unix/X99`) survives the container's writable layer across `docker restart` (restart re-runs the entrypoint but keeps the FS), so the relaunched X server collides (`(EE) Server is already active for display 99`) and Electron segfaults; the backend never binds `:23373`, socat loops `connection refused`, container stuck `health: starting`. Only a full `down`/`up` (fresh `/tmp`) recovers. **Fix:** in `entrypoint.sh`, before Xvfb starts — `rm -f /tmp/.X99-lock /tmp/.X11-unix/X*`. One line; makes restart survivable (restart is the natural op after any config/code change). **(2) `beepertexts` runs unsupervised — a crash leaves a silent half-dead container.** It's launched once with `&`, no relaunch loop. On any crash the MCP layer (`:23375`) stays up and answers, but every tool call returns `-32603 fetch failed` (backend gone): looks "running," never self-heals. **Fix:** supervise it (relaunch loop) **or** `exec` it as the PID-managed foreground process so a crash exits the container and Docker's restart policy recreates it (pair with fix 1 so the recreate doesn't re-segfault); and point the healthcheck at `:23373/v1/spec` (not just `:23375`) so a dead backend flips unhealthy fast. **Repro this session:** `docker restart beeperbox` → segfault → required a local image rebuild + `up --force-recreate` to recover. **Acceptance:** `docker restart beeperbox` returns to a working API within the healthcheck window; an inner-app crash either self-heals or marks the container unhealthy — no silent half-dead state. | **RESOLVED (2026-06-15)** — B(1) stale-Xvfb-lock fix shipped in **PR #12**; B(2) supervised `beepertexts` (with an `API_WAS_UP` first-login gate) + env-var sanitization (busy-loop + silent-disable fixes) shipped in **PR #13**. Real kill/relaunch cycle is CI-unverifiable (needs a live container) — multis to confirm restart-survival on the `:edge` image during the Ask-A re-validation. **multis VERIFIED (2026-06-15):** `docker restart beeperbox` recovered clean (no segfault, no "display 99 already active" — B(1) holds); B(2) supervisor proven on a real crash — SIGKILL `beepertexts` → log `[!!] beepertexts exited — relaunching` → API recovered in ~10s, container `healthy`. Both CI-unverifiable limits closed. |

## 8. Design-simplification register *(things we questioned and changed)*

| Date | What | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-06-15 | LLM-summarize capture pipeline | Retire (§B B2 locked) — usefulness-weighted promotion ladder + explicit `/remember` instead |
| 2026-06-15 | **Slash `/exec` `/read` bypassed the gate** (M0 finding) | FIXED — `routeExec`/`routeRead` now run the same `gov.resolve().policy` as the LLM tool path. governance = bareguard on every privileged entry point. Multis wiring (Principle 2). |
| 2026-06-16 | **Dual transport in multis** (bare Desktop raw `/v1/` + beeperbox MCP, considered for M-B step 3) | **REJECTED** — would re-introduce the seed/dedup/echo bug-class on the Desktop path, or fork beeperbox's id-resolution/cursor logic into multis (two copies of transport smarts to maintain — the exact thing the migration deletes). Unnecessary: beeperbox's `mcp/server.js` is zero-dep vanilla Node and takes `BEEPER_API`, so it fronts **any** Beeper Desktop (containerized OR a user's local Desktop via "lite mode") with the *same* verbs. → multis stays a **single MCP client**; bare-Desktop users run the lite server and get the reliable echo-guard/cursor too. Transport stays in beeperbox (Principle 1). |
| 2026-06-15 | **Checkpoint is a parallel approval path** (F2, M0 finding) | **DONE (2026-06-15)** — cutover executed. `config.security.checkpoint_tools` → `flags:{type:{<gateType>:'ask'}}` in `buildGateConfig` (default `['exec']`); Checkpoint wiring removed from `runAgentLoop`; checkpoint reply path + `bot/checkpoint.js` deleted; confirmation flows through the single `humanChannel`. `buildGateConfig` now composes `SAFE_DEFAULT_ASK_PATTERNS` (was clobbering). **Behavior change (intended):** slash `/exec` now also asks (was LLM-path only) — uniform governance. Proven at three levels (primitive POC + wiring tests + mutation/failability). |

## 9. Definition of done (whole migration)

- No homegrown memory, indexer, or context-assembly code remains; all on litectx.
- `bare-agent 0.16`, `bareguard 0.7`, `litectx 0.16` pinned.
- Every "lib's job" subsystem is lib-native, not a shim; every gap found is filed (§7), not patched in multis.
- Smoke steps 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 run in CI via the M0 net.
- Beeper works unchanged against local Desktop **and** against beeperbox by config alone (M-B round-trip recorded).
